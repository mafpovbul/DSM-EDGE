Database design - links

Brief Timeline

Features/Variables:
-UD Sheets
	-No. of plies
	-Shape of plies (Filler plies - Circle,oval,Cross,etc)
	-Ply arrangement/sequence
	-Ply material (Grade of UD sheets)
-Mould (diff types, assume same)
-Pressure, Temp


Goal/Indicators:
-Weight
-Price?
-Thickness of helmet
	-Measured at different points
-Ballistic Performance
	-V50 (speed of bullet at which 50% of bullets are caught, 50% penetrate)
	-E.g. shot at 10 diff locations on the same helmet, 50% of bullets are caught, 50% penetrate
	-Taken at differet points of the helmet


Goal of database:
Customer vs engineer database
Shape - uniform thickness
Material vs performance
-Key in requirements, database to show up the optimal materials/factors

Ideas:
CNN using light-table image of helmet
Input helmet image - output expected ballistic performance
